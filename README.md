**Dataset** 📊

The HR dataset used for analysis contains 1200 rows and 28 columns. You can access the dataset [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NXJcCfUPsu1ldysmHFPfIufN6HT9s29x/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101218975538808492645&rtpof=true&sd=true).

**Findings (Python)** 🐍

1. Performance ratings for employees in the Data Science department are the highest. 🚀
2. Performance ratings for employees in the Sales department are the lowest. 💼
3. Most employees have performance ratings greater than 3. 👍
4. Male employees outnumber female employees in all performance rating ranges. 👨‍💼👩‍💼
5. A significant number of employees fall in the age group of 30–40, while there are very few in the age group of 55–60. 📅
6. The majority of the working class is in their late 30’s. 👴
7. Many employees were promoted frequently, within 0–1.5 years. 📈
8. The Life Sciences education background has the greatest number of employees, followed by Medical. 📚
9. Human Resources has the lowest number of employees. 🤷‍♂️

**Findings (Machine Learning)** 🤖

1. A Logistic Regression model was designed to predict employee performance rating with an accuracy of 73%. 🎯
2. A Random Forest classification model was designed to predict employee performance rating with an accuracy of 93%. 🌲


**Conclusion** 🎉

1.The analysis reveals insights into employee performance ratings based on department, gender, age group, education background, and promotion frequency. Additionally, the Random Forest algorithm emerges as the superior choice for predicting performance ratings, offering high accuracy and effective use of data. These findings could aid in HR decision-making processes and workforce management strategies. 📊
2.Random Forest outperformed other algorithms due to its optimal utilization of the entire dataset, reducing bias error, and providing maximum reduction in variance by averaging outputs from an ensemble of decision trees. 🏆
